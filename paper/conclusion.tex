\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, a multi-output Gaussian process regression model is proposed, the reduced-rank Gaussian processes are constructed from feature maps approximated by neural network. The correlations between tasks are represented by the shared layers of the neural network. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms independent GP modeling and other state-of-the-art multi-output GP models.
